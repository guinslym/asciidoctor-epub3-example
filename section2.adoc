= Changing the Cover Image

Ereaders have different image resolution and file size limits regarding a book's cover.
Kindle covers tend to be 1050x1600 (16:9 resolution), which is the size of the sample cover provided with {project-name}.
To ensure your cover displays correctly, you'll want to review the documentation or publisher guidelines for the reading platform you're targeting.

WARNING: We've found that if the book cover is more than 1600px on any side, Aldiko will not render it and may even crash.

Feel free to use the SVG of the sample cover in the [path]_data/images_ folder as a template for creating your own cover.
Once your image is ready, you can replace the placeholder cover image by defining the `front-cover-image` attribute in the header of the master document.

:front-cover-image: image:cover.png[Front Cover,1050,1600]

The image is resolved relative to the directory specified in the `imagesdir` attribute, which defaults to the directory of the spine document.
The image can be in any format, though we recommend using PNG, JPG, or SVG as they are the most portable formats.

IMPORTANT: *You should always specify the dimensions of the cover image.*
This ensures the viewer will preserve the aspect ratio if it needs to be scaled to fit the screen.
If you don't specify a width and height, then the dimensions are assumed to be 1050x1600.

=== How to Organize Images by Chapter

You can set the `imagesdir` attribute per chapter (as long as the attribute is not overridden by the API).
To do so, use an attribute entry to set the value of the `imagesdir` attribute on the line above the include directive for a chapter.

----
:imagesdir: chapter-one/images
\include::chapter-one.adoc[]

:imagesdir: chapter-two/images
\include::chapter-two.adoc[]
