== Example

this document shows you how to create an asciidoctor-epub3 document

== Readme

My first book published made with asciidoctor

=== Prerequisites
  ☐ rvm install ruby-2.0.0-p648
  ☐ rvm use ruby-2.0.0-p648
  ☐ NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=1 gem install asciidoctor-epub3 --pre

=== Command:
  ☐ asciidoctor-epub3 -D output spine.adoc



=== Notes
  1.  Do not use the latest version of ruby (issue with asciidoctor-epub3)
  2. Creating epub needs to have a special layout (see the asciidoctor-epub3 documentation)
  3. The `spine` must be the first document of the project. You can call this file whatever you want but it must content a Table of Content (TOC) style stucture of your document (see example)
